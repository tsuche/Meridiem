# meridiem

I don't think that you're even suppose to write this inside a readme document, so excuse my noob energy.

This is a website that I and 2 other people created for our first HACKATHON, Hack The Cloud.

Our team name, just for funzies is, Meridiem. 

Our 2-day project consists of a distorted, if I had to say so myself, webpage and a mini-python game.

Two of our members, including myself only knew basic HTML and CSS while our last member knew a bit of python. 

We wanted to create a webpage to showcase our potential game made with python. 

We used repl.it to collaborate.

However, we ran into tons of problems, and the biggest one being: how to import the python game into our webpage. 

The game repository/code is on another GitHub user's account, our other team member.

If you're interested, there is a link to it inside our website (the index.html in master branch) where you can download and try out our game. Including further information about the game, how to play, our obstacles, and many more!!

The hackathon was fun. 

I learned so much additional HTML and CSS, and this is my first completed webpage/website I've ever created. Haha

My biggest achievement was probably animations.

My teammates were also so easy-going, open-minded, and patient. 

I, personally had a good time, I would definitely do another hackathon. 

The only downside is that the hackathon made me feel so drained afterwards.

I slept for 13 hours, more than a whole day!!

That's all I'm going to say for this readme. 

Thanks for stopping by :) 

Have a good day!
